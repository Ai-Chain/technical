# technical

Welcome to Technical, where things are, well technical. This is a simple collection of indicators and utils to make the day to day operation
of working with the freqtrade trading bot easier and more powerful!

## What does it due for you

We basically provide you with easy to use indicators, collected from all over github and custom methods. Over time we plan to provide a simple API wrapper
around TA-Lib, PyTi and others, as we find them. So you have one place, to find 100s of indicators.

### Custom indicators

We will happily add your custom indicators to this repo!

### Utilities

1. resample - easily resample your dataframe to a larger interval
2. merge - merge your resampled dataframe into your original dataframe, so you can build triggers on more than 1 interval!
